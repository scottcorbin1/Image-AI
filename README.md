# Image-AI
An AI to predict the labels of images
In order to run this Program there are a few things that you will need to make sure are done first. Make sure that the h5 file is in the same folder as the py file. It will come in there by default but if you move the py file to another folder you will need to move the h5 file with it. 

Packages
You will need to install the following packages to run the program.
Numpy 
Pygame
Tkinter
Tensorflow
matplotlib

Without the above packages installed on your system the py file will crash as the program is dependent on them. 

Running the program
When you run the program it may take a minute for it to display the GUI. That is normal when running for the first time. After the first initial run each successive run should display the GUI much faster. 

Using the Program
Using the program is very simple. It will show you 9 images on the screen and at the top it will ask you to select a specific category of image. Simply click the image or images you believe to be correct. When you click to select an image the outline will become green, to deselect just click the image again and the green outline will go away. Once you are satisfied with your selections click the done button at the bottom of the screen and it will tell you how right you were with your selections. At this point you can click the continue button or end button. The end button will terminate the program. The continue button will take you back to the starting screen and you will be prompted to select an image or images or a specific category again. 
If at any point you wish to quit and you are not on the screen with the end button then just click the x at the upper right corner of the window.
